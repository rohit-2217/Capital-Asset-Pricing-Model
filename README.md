# CAPM Project: Calculating Expected Returns of Stocks using CAPM in Python


Project Overview
This project focuses on calculating the risk-adjusted expected returns of select stocks using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in Python. The CAPM model is a widely recognized financial framework that helps investors make informed decisions by assessing the expected return of an asset based on its risk and market conditions.

Getting Data
To calculate the expected returns, we first need historical data for the stocks of interest. The stocks analyzed in this project are:

Bharti Airtel
HDFC Bank
ITC
The chosen benchmark for this analysis is NIFTY 50, which tracks the top 50 companies in the Indian stock market by market capitalization. We retrieve the necessary data using the Python Yahoo Finance library, covering the last 5 years (January 2019 to the present).

Data Preprocessing
Before we can derive meaningful insights from the data, we perform normalization of stock prices. Normalization is crucial to ensure efficient cross-stock data comparison.

CAPM Model
The heart of this project lies in the CAPM model. We visualize the daily returns of the selected stocks alongside the benchmark index and fit a regression line to the scattered data. The key components of this analysis include:

Beta Value: The slope of the regression line represents the beta value, which signifies the stock's sensitivity to market movements. Higher beta indicates higher risk.

Alpha Value: The intercept of the regression line gives us the alpha value, reflecting the stock's risk-adjusted performance. Positive alpha implies superior performance.

We utilize these beta and alpha values to assess the relative risk and return of different stocks. This information is invaluable for making informed investment decisions.

Comparing Expected and Historical Returns
To complete our analysis, we calculate the mean annual returns generated by the stocks based on historical data. We then compare these actual returns to the expected returns derived from the CAPM model. This comparison aids in evaluating how stocks have performed relative to market expectations.
